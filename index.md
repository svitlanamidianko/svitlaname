hi internet friend, welcome in 🌻 
<br/><br/> 
i am Svitlana and i enjoy creating 3C spaces - spaces that are Consious, Curious, and Collective. here are some ways i do it. 
<br/><br/> 
as a Yoga Teacher, i create 3C spaces with breath and movement. 
<br/><br/> 
as a Technologist, i create 3C spaces with code and color. 
<br/><br/>
as a [Coach](https://svitlana.mmm.page/coach), i create 3C spaces with attention and care. 
<br/><br/>
as a Life Artist, i create 3C spaces with my being and expression.
<br/><br/> 
as a Writer, i create 3C spaces with words and metaphors. 
<br/><br/>
i was born and raised in Ukraine (feel at ease asking me about yes very brutal ongoing war, which is not a conflict). i then over-achieved into and at Minerva for undergrad CS degree. i am now learning how to rest, slow down, and show up in the internet world while feeling safe and secure in my own Self. today, i live in san francisco next to many trees🌲. 

<br/><br/>
huggingly,
