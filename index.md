hi human bean, welcome to this frame of the world üêå 
<br/><br/> 
my name is Svitlana and i am a Life Artist intending to cultivate 3C spaces - spaces that are Consious, Curious, and Collective. with multitude of identities withing me, i observe how Yoga Teacher, [Coach](https://svitlana.mmm.page/coach), and Technologist have been the most alive and playful latelyüõù :) 
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
here are some of my recent 3C-anchored creations: 
<br/><br/>
[1] [Pond.Space](https://www.pond.space/) - a digital journal with an AI Fish swimming around as your teacher. it is also [our](curlprojects.com) first Experiential Software experiment, so it blends in the vibes of both an app and a game at the same time. 
<br/><br/>
[2] [FormTranslator.com](formtranslator.com) - a tool for translating between Ontological Forms. it is as if a Fuzzy and Ineffable is wearing different "vocabulary clothes." <br/><br/>
[3] [Garden of Infinite selves](https://svitlanamm.substack.com/i/175916691/garden-of-infinite-selves-is-my-new-life-long-art-project-each-flower-represents-an-infinite-self-within-me-inspired-by-ifs-frame-of-thinking-internal-family-systems-ifs-is-a-form-of-therapy-that-breaks-down-the-single-self-into-a-family-of-selves-each-with-its-own-needs-and-desires) - an art project with each Flower representing an Infinite Self within me inspired by IFS frame of thinking.

as a high-energy [kid](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/58Zr64aZwD3LVVUmi0TOWJ?si=ba74119b794546db), i play in wide range of games: sometimes as a clown [upside down]((https://www.instagram.com/svitlana_moves/)), sometimes as a geeky PM at Google, sometimes as a [storyteller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5Y9FKsY-Y), and most often as a main character of my own inner sitcom. 
<br/><br/>
i was born and raised in Ukraine (feel at ease asking me about yes very brutal ongoing war, which is not a conflict). i then over-achieved into and at Minerva for undergrad. i am now learning how to rest, slow down, and show up in the internet world while feeling safe and secure in my own self. today, i live in san francisco with next to many treesüå≤. 

<br/><br/>
huggingly,
