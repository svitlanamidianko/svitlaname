hi internet friend, <br/><br/> 
i am svitlana and my mission is to cultivate 3C spaces - spaces that are Conscious, Curious, and Collective. here and now, i am exploring Experiential Software, Yoga, Life Art, Writing as containers for 3C spaces.

 <br/><br/>

one of the technological experiments of a 3C space is our [pond.space](https://www.pond.space/). it is a living journal for growing the self through mindful practice.   <br/><br/>


i seek beauty, growth and self-discovery through conscious creative practice, [movement](https://www.instagram.com/svitlana_moves/), inner work, [writing](https://svitlanamm.substack.com),  comedy, life art, mind research, social design.   <br/><br/>
