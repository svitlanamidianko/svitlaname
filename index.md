hi internet friend, welcome in 🌲
<br/><br/> 
<br/><br/>
i am Svitlana and i enjoy creating **3C spaces - spaces that are Consious, Curious, and Collective**. here are some ways i do it:
<br/><br/>
🌱 as a **Yoga Teacher**, i create 3C spaces with breath and movement. 
<br/><br/> 
🌱 as a **Technologist** and **Mindware Engineer**, i create 3C spaces with code and APIs. 
<br/><br/>
🌱 as a **[Coach](https://svitlana.mmm.page/coach)**, i create 3C spaces with attention and care. 
<br/><br/>
🌱 as a **Life Artist**, i create 3C spaces with my being and expression.
<br/><br/> 
🌱 as a **[Writer](https://svitlanamm.substack.com/)**, i create 3C spaces with words and metaphors. 
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
huggingly,
