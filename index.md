hi internet friend, <br/><br/> 
i am svitlana and my mission is to cultivate 3C spaces - spaces that are conscious, curious, and collective.   <br/><br/>


currently i am exploring experiential software as means to it and direct my attention to [pond.space](https://www.pond.space/) - a living journal  for growing the self through mindful practice.   <br/><br/>


i seek beauty, growth and self-discovery through conscious creative practice, yoga, [movement](https://www.instagram.com/svitlana_moves/), inner work, [writing](https://svitlanamm.substack.com),  comedy, life art, mind research, experiential and social design.   <br/><br/>


find me playing under the trees of san francisco ðŸŒ³  <br/><br/>
