hi internet friend, welcome in 🌻 
<br/><br/> 
i am Svitlana and i enjoy creating 3C spaces - spaces that are Consious, Curious, and Collective. 
<br/><br/> 
here are some ways i do it:
<br/><br/>
[1] as a **Yoga Teacher**, i create 3C spaces with breath and movement. 
<br/><br/> 
[2] as a **Technologist** and **Mindware Engineer**, i create 3C spaces with code and APIs. 
<br/><br/>
[3] as a [Coach](https://svitlana.mmm.page/coach), i create 3C spaces with attention and care. 
<br/><br/>
[4] as a **Life Artist**, i create 3C spaces with my being and expression.
<br/><br/> 
[5] as a [Writer](https://svitlanamm.substack.com/), i create 3C spaces with words and metaphors. 
<br/><br/>
i was born and raised in Ukraine. i then over-achieved into and at Minerva University where i obtained undergrad Data Science & AI degree. 
<br/><br/>
today, i live in san francisco next to many trees🌲 and learning how to rest, slow down, and show up in the internet world while feeling safe and secure in my own Self.
