hi internet friend, <br/><br/> 
i am svitlana and my mission is to cultivate 3C spaces - spaces that are Conscious, Curious, and Collective.
 <br/><br/>

one of my technological expriments for holding such a space is [pond.space](https://www.pond.space/). it is a living journal for growing the self through mindful practice and also our first attempt at creating Experiential Software that prioritizes journey over destination and feels like both app and a game at the same time.  <br/><br/>




i seek beauty, growth and self-discovery through conscious creative practice, [movement](https://www.instagram.com/svitlana_moves/), yoga student-ing and yoga teaching, inner work, [writing](https://svitlanamm.substack.com),  comedy, life art, mind research, social design.   <br/><br/>




find me playing under the trees of san francisco ðŸŒ³  <br/><br/>
