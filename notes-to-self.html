          <li><strong>It's common to believe that life is a series of external experiences. And that we must live an outwardly extraordinary life in order to have something to share. The experience of our inner world is often completely overlooked. — Rick Rubin</strong></li>

Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer."
